# Mobile-Phones-Kenya

The project contains the analysis of mobile phone manufacturers, models, specifications and prices in Kenya. Its main purpose is to understand the mobile devices' landscape in Kenya.

The project assisted me study and understand more about data analysis, as it was my first project. The main challenge that I acquired was data mixup during data cleaning process.

I got my data from Kaggle and enhanced it by adding countries of manufacture for the phones.

This project required the use of: 
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Power BI</li>
  <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
  <li>Power Query</li>
</ul>

I used two data sets obtained from different sources. I  merged the files and then cleaned them using Excel and Power Query.

I give credits to Cisco, Robin Hunt and Emma Saunders for the various training materials that I used to understand data analytics in a bigger, better way.
