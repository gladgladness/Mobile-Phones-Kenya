# MobilePhonesKenya_Excel_PowerBI
<h2>Setup and User Story</h2>
The project contains the analysis of mobile phone manufacturers, models, specifications and prices in Kenya. Its main purpose is to understand the mobile devices' landscape in Kenya.

The project assisted me study and understand more about data analysis, as it was my first project. The main challenge that I encountered during data cleaning process was that data got mixed up after splitting columns, leading to the process taking longer.
  
I got my data from Kaggle and enhanced it by adding countries of manufacture for the phones.

This project required the use of: 
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop</li>
  <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
  <li>Power Query</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
I used two data sets obtained from different sources. I  merged the files and then cleaned them using Excel and Power Query. This was possible through creation of conditional columns, splitting columns, removing blanks and changing the data types.
<h2>Creating Report in Power BI</h2>
I put together the report using:
<ul>
  <li>Table</li>
  <li>Pie Chart</li>
  <li>Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Combo Chart</li>
  <li>Scatter Graph</li>
  <li>Multi Row Card</li>
  <li>Slicers for filtering</li>
  <li>Bookmarks and Arrow Buttons for Navigation</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
I give credits to Cisco, Robin Hunt and Emma Saunders for the various training materials that I used to understand data analytics in a bigger, better way.
